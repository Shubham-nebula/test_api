 Adam Hollohan>My cameras not working, so you're going to have to pretend it's, uh, nice, good looking guy, right?

00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:32.581
 Jeff Campbell>Ohh, don't worry about that.

00:07:32.731 --> 00:07:33.551
 Jeff Campbell>Don't worry about that.

00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:36.941
 Dean Finch>No, I I am Dean here as well.

00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:33.941
 Jeff Campbell>You don't.

00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:34.471
 Jeff Campbell>We don't need it.

00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:37.491

 Jeff Campbell>Adam, I think you might be cutting out.

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:05.571
 Jeff Campbell>You there, Adam?

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.421
 Jeff Campbell>Let me know on the chat if you need to have if we need.

00:08:26.431 --> 00:08:30.131
 Jeff Campbell>If you just need me to call you Adam or something, if you're mic's not working, I can do that.

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.581
 Adam Hollohan>Just got maybe 4 Internet connection right now.

00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:35.951
 Dean Finch>All that sounds better there, Adam.

00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:37.641
 Adam Hollohan>1st to my other network.

00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:38.471
 Adam Hollohan>Can you hear me?

00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.231
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, I can.

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:41.861
 Adam Hollohan>Awesome. OK.

00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:44.021
 Jeff Campbell>Perfect.

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:47.051
 Jeff Campbell>So Adam, tell me about uh, why?

00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:47.831
 Dean Finch>Adam, yet I don't know if you heard me, Dean.

00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.741
 Dean Finch>Here I'm on the call too, so just so you know, nice to meet you out.

00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:50.911
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:57.031
 Jeff Campbell>So Adam, tell me about why you're here looking at service Box today.

00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:58.231
 Jeff Campbell>Why you're looking for a solution?

00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:04.371
 Adam Hollohan>We do about 12 kitchens a week for cabinetry.

00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.631
 Adam Hollohan>Deliver and install uh.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:09.151
 Adam Hollohan>We currently use Google Calendar.

00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:24.421
 Adam Hollohan>Uh, it came up on my phone that you have like a A, you know, a drag and drop on the calendar trying to get something a little bit more integrated that, you know, uh everyone's connected.

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:32.051
 Adam Hollohan>I got three people in the scheduling department, so just looking for more of a better solution than Google Calendar.

00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:35.971
 Jeff Campbell>So three people in the scheduling department and how many texts do you have out in the field?

00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:37.591
 Adam Hollohan>7 to 8.

00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:40.201
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:51.231
 Jeff Campbell>So tell me about how your you know how you're kind of day to day process goes right now with Google calendars.

00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.431
 Jeff Campbell>You know how someone calls in for a job?

00:09:54.561 --> 00:10:01.021
 Jeff Campbell>You know how your text maybe pick up work orders that that perhaps get created for them?

00:10:01.811 --> 00:10:04.311
 Jeff Campbell>Umm, let me know a little bit about that.

00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:05.381
 Adam Hollohan>Sure.

00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.261
 Adam Hollohan>Uh, we have a separate location showroom.

00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:13.421
 Adam Hollohan>They will called a job.

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.411
 Adam Hollohan>We go up to measure design.

00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:20.691
 Adam Hollohan>Uh, you know, price finalized details.

00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:31.711
 Adam Hollohan>So once that job is kind of completed on the design end that gets sent to a separate location or factory where we're gonna make all of our own cabinets.

00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:33.431
 Adam Hollohan>Umm.

00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:38.541
 Adam Hollohan>So basically job comes down, gets put on our calendar based on our production timeline.

00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:40.041
 Adam Hollohan>Uh.

00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:54.701
 Adam Hollohan>And then on that calendar, we fill out, you know, client information where they're located, umm, and how many boxes are with the job just for scheduling purposes of knowing what we can, what we can do in that week.

00:10:57.381 --> 00:11:08.461
 Adam Hollohan>Then we reach out to the client via call or email, set up a tentative installation date, and then you know basically closer to that timeline.

00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:14.261
 Adam Hollohan>We will have a check in to see if the job sites progressing as it should before the cabinets are installed.

00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:17.461
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:11:19.161 --> 00:11:24.241
 Adam Hollohan>So about, I would say two a week to two weeks before.

00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:28.791
 Adam Hollohan>Well, from up a date with the client on delivery.

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:29.911
 Adam Hollohan>So we deliver our cabinets.

00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:34.741
 Adam Hollohan>A day before our install, we have our own in-house delivery.

00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:39.621
 Adam Hollohan>So we'll deliver the cabinets two days between, you know a day or two before the install.

00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:46.341
 Adam Hollohan>We go out and install it and then any deficiencies like open orders or items missing from the job.

00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:49.671
 Adam Hollohan>We have to reschedule with the client to go back and get them cleaned up.

00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:54.581
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:11:57.561 --> 00:12:08.491
 Dean Finch>So so Adam, the reason we're asking all the questions is are job today is to figure out whether our software can adapt to your process and kind of or the things you could maybe change.

00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:06.201
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:12.291
 Dean Finch>So we don't wanna, we're not trying to put a square peg in a round hole here.

00:12:12.301 --> 00:12:14.431
 Dean Finch>We wanna really figure out what you're doing.

00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:15.431
 Dean Finch>So we can do that.

00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:21.291
 Dean Finch>So when you're doing those jobs, this could take it could take quite a few months.

00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:26.871
 Dean Finch>I mean, you're you're probably doing is at houses that are being renovated or is it new homes you're doing or both?

00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:27.251
 Adam Hollohan>Great question.

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:28.651
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, by all means, ask.

00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:29.981
 Adam Hollohan>That's a part of the sales process.

00:12:29.991 --> 00:12:31.141
 Adam Hollohan>You wanna show me a solution?

00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:31.021
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:32.351
 Adam Hollohan>That's not gonna work for my company.

00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:35.001
 Adam Hollohan>Umm, yeah.

00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:34.161
 Dean Finch>Yeah, for sure.

00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:37.081
 Adam Hollohan>So we do like 2 clients, we do new builds.

00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:47.941
 Adam Hollohan>You know guys who are building, you know, homes from start to finish and then we do renovations where someone is you know update updating their kitchen.

00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:41.311
 Dean Finch>Right.

00:12:47.951 --> 00:13:00.521
 Adam Hollohan>So simple renovation could be just removing the current layout and installing something brand new or drastic renovation would be like they're altering the design and the layout of the cabinetry, which would require more time on site.

00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:05.421
 Adam Hollohan>So we can't promise part of me.

00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:02.201
 Dean Finch>Right.

00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:02.961
 Dean Finch>Do you coordinate?

00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.221
 Dean Finch>Do you coordinate the other trades?

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:08.021
 Dean Finch>Do you coordinate the other trades then?

00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:10.311
 Dean Finch>Like the electrical and and the and the and the plumbing.

00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:12.371
 Adam Hollohan>No, no, that's for the client to do.

00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:13.771
 Dean Finch>OK, OK.

00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:15.551
 Adam Hollohan>Now we'll guide them like you know they need information.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:22.711
 Adam Hollohan>So you know if electricians going in and moving plugs and stuff, they need our blueprints and guidance on that.

00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:24.211
 Adam Hollohan>But no, we don't coordinate other traits.

00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:31.611
 Jeff Campbell>So Adam, for the most part, you know, you're you're getting a job quote and you're you're uh getting.

00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:25.841
 Dean Finch>OK.

00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:32.431
 Jeff Campbell>Excuse me.

00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:34.211
 Jeff Campbell>Getting a job from a customer?

00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:35.351
 Jeff Campbell>You're quoting that job for them.

00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:46.341
 Jeff Campbell>You're designing those cabinets, you're taking them back, you're manufacturing them, and then you are setting up a date with the customer after creating essentially a work order.

00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:52.921
 Jeff Campbell>And then you're setting up a date to install and you just want to be able to set that up.

00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:59.491
 Jeff Campbell>So your guys are out in the field, they pick that work order up from their phone out in the field.

00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:05.621
 Jeff Campbell>They can open that up and they can go through that got job out in the field and everything's connected under one roof.

00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:08.021
 Jeff Campbell>You can invoice right out of the app as well.

00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:11.261
 Jeff Campbell>Is that essentially what you're hoping to do with the software?

00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:11.941
 Adam Hollohan>The only things not too bad.

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:20.371
 Adam Hollohan>We're not, you know, because if we do like a new build where we go and install the kitchen, you know, our contractors got 3045, you know, net 30, net, 45 days.

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:23.361
 Adam Hollohan>If it's retail, we get our check upon delivery.

00:14:24.351 --> 00:14:32.291
 Adam Hollohan>Umm, so you know automatic invoicing is a great option, but it's not really a necessity.

00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:44.491
 Adam Hollohan>I guess the biggest thing that of why I'm looking into this is because of, you know, if you got two or three people scheduling every time they make a call for attacks, they have to go into the Google Calendar.

00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:49.071
 Adam Hollohan>And like you know, indicate the communication log and it gets missed quite frequently.

00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:56.471
 Adam Hollohan>And also just like reminders to clients that, hey, you're delivery scheduled, you know just better record keeping as well?

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:55.341
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:14:58.051 --> 00:14:58.331
 Dean Finch>Alright.

00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:00.711
 Jeff Campbell>So with that, with that reminder.

00:14:59.101 --> 00:14:59.981
 Adam Hollohan>Better tribe from.

00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:13.311
 Adam Hollohan>Looking for better tracking like so if you know it's on the way or I step out and I go on to another uh, another project, I can easily like, you know, load up something and look adequate.

00:15:13.321 --> 00:15:15.871
 Adam Hollohan>How many jobs do we install in September?

00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.131
 Adam Hollohan>You know what deficiencies are there?

00:15:19.141 --> 00:15:22.271
 Adam Hollohan>How long have the jobs been outstanding for, you know, better?

00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.801
 Adam Hollohan>Better access to information as well.

00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:24.831
 Dean Finch>Sure.

00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:25.441
 Jeff Campbell>Absolutely.

00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:29.441
 Jeff Campbell>Absolutely.

00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:34.051
 Jeff Campbell>Well, I I would like to show you in our system how you know.

00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:41.971
 Dean Finch>I one question told you, Jeff, before we do that quotes what do you what do you use to create your quotes today?

00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:43.861
 Dean Finch>Do you provide those your drawings?

00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:47.851
 Dean Finch>And I'm sure you have a kitchen design program of some kind.

00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.481
 Dean Finch>Do you share PDFs of those drawings with your clients?

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.221
 Dean Finch>That kind of thing.

00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:53.321
 Dean Finch>And what process to use to call them?

00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:52.171
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:57.161
 Adam Hollohan>Uh quoting is just a quote log on Excel.

00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:01.541
 Adam Hollohan>Just to generate a new number and it's just a Microsoft Word.

00:15:59.661 --> 00:15:59.891
 Dean Finch>Mm-hmm.

00:16:01.591 --> 00:16:06.001
 Adam Hollohan>So pretty old school, just a template that we will revise and send to the client.

00:16:03.571 --> 00:16:03.811
 Dean Finch>Yep.

00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:14.981
 Adam Hollohan>So we have an Excel program that will just generate a quote number and then after that quote is sold it becomes a a job number or work order number.

00:16:16.021 --> 00:16:16.251
 Dean Finch>Yep.

00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:22.971
 Adam Hollohan>Uh, they recorded in the showroom and then we recorded again manual entry at the shop.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.351
 Adam Hollohan>But the design blueprints are done in 2020 design.

00:16:26.851 --> 00:16:30.611
 Adam Hollohan>We will send a PDF of the blueprints to the client.

00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:36.201
 Adam Hollohan>They sign off and also it comes down to the factory to understand how to manufacture the kitchen.

00:16:36.991 --> 00:16:37.411
 Dean Finch>Right.

00:16:38.071 --> 00:16:56.121
 Dean Finch>OK, so that document that you send to the customer as a quote is that more of A is it got, you've got your pricing in it obviously, but it's also have a lot of other information in it to try and get them to understand what you're doing like is it a thoroughly intense document or is it just a quote?

00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:58.671
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, it's no, it's pretty pretty intense.

00:16:58.681 --> 00:17:03.091
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, it's, you know, your blueprint of your kitchen show on the sides of your cabinets.

00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:06.161
 Adam Hollohan>It'll have different views like a a picture view.

00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:12.421
 Adam Hollohan>Uh, and also a contract of like what color door shaped handles specification.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:17.131
 Adam Hollohan>So yeah, it's it's definitely like a 15 to 20 page uh.

00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:19.901
 Adam Hollohan>Document so it's pretty, I would say it's pretty intense for sure.

00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:20.901
 Dean Finch>Yeah, for sure.

00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:21.521
 Dean Finch>Yeah. OK.

00:17:22.051 --> 00:17:23.211
 Dean Finch>Yeah, just trying to understand that.

00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:29.991
 Dean Finch>Yeah, I've.

00:17:30.001 --> 00:17:36.771
 Dean Finch>I've gotten several kitchens and homes built, so I'm I'm I've been on the receiving end of your your type of process?

00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:37.881
 Dean Finch>A couple of times I don't.

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:39.011
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:17:39.881 --> 00:17:40.021
 Dean Finch>Yep.

00:17:40.981 --> 00:17:51.001
 Jeff Campbell>So Adam, let me show you how you how I think that you're gonna you're you're might be able to use service box and I and I do think it's it's certainly worth going through demo and showing you this stuff. Umm.

00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.661
 Jeff Campbell>So you should be able to see my screen here.

00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:56.581
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:17:58.061 --> 00:17:59.781
 Jeff Campbell>So what we're going to do is I'm going to create a quote.

00:18:02.601 --> 00:18:03.441
 Jeff Campbell>We're going to turn that.

00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:04.801
 Jeff Campbell>We're going to get that quote approved.

00:18:04.811 --> 00:18:06.611
 Jeff Campbell>We're going to turn that quote into a work order.

00:18:06.981 --> 00:18:19.941
 Jeff Campbell>We're going to schedule that work order and then go through a workflow on the install and everything like that, tracking information at that job site that you're installing at, you know, tracking all the info that you can.

00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:25.301
 Jeff Campbell>You can go back on and then I do want to show you how you can invoice out of here as well because it's just a click of a button.

00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:26.331
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:18:26.471 --> 00:18:28.261
 Jeff Campbell>So let me take you through that process.

00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:35.351
 Jeff Campbell>What you're viewing here is the desktop version of service box.

00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:41.251
 Jeff Campbell>So everything that I'm doing here you can do inside the mobile app remotely as well.

00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:42.151
 Jeff Campbell>Do keep that in mind.

00:18:42.161 --> 00:18:49.201
 Jeff Campbell>It's just as intuitive inside the mobile app, but we're working inside of the desktop version here the the browser version of service Box.

00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:52.801
 Jeff Campbell>So I'm gonna go up from new here.

00:18:52.811 --> 00:19:02.391
 Jeff Campbell>We're gonna go down to quote, and that's going to bring up our create new quote page here as you see, you've got templates that you can use.

00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:15.671
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, in your world, likely not gonna use them, but if you do have similar things that you do often, you wanna be able to just pick a template and it kind of fills everything in for you there in your materials and other things like that.

00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:25.091
 Jeff Campbell>Even you know O and all you have to do after that is throwing a bill to in a job site and you know you're you're set, you can tweak anything that you need in there as well.

00:19:25.101 --> 00:19:29.191
 Jeff Campbell>But again, in that case, I doubt you're gonna use that, because most of your stuff's custom.

00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:39.521
 Jeff Campbell>This I'm gonna turn off the you don't even need to worry about this unless you're you are running out of multiple locations, which sounded like you might be.

00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:52.501
 Jeff Campbell>If you do wanna split up those different locations and you have different texts in those different locations, that's a way of breaking that stuff up so that it's separated from everybody else.

00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:59.731
 Jeff Campbell>If you're not going to use that, though, you can turn that component off and that goes with anything else inside of service box that you aren't going to use.

00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:05.171
 Jeff Campbell>We're going to tailor service box down to your workflow so that you're only seeing the stuff that you need to see inside of here.

00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:16.191
 Jeff Campbell>We've got a very configurable software and that's part of our our setup process as well as getting things configured to your company to the best of our systems capabilities of course, which is pretty flexible.

00:20:18.281 --> 00:20:18.481
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:20.931
 Jeff Campbell>So we can go and put in a bill to here.

00:20:20.981 --> 00:20:24.061
 Jeff Campbell>We can add a new bill to a a new customer inside of here.

00:20:24.071 --> 00:20:41.161
 Jeff Campbell>This will create a brand new customer for us inside of service box and it will add them as the build to as well in here or pick a preexisting one if if you have existing customers that you work for I can go and put that, put that in you maybe commercial customers or something like that.

00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:26.741
 Adam Hollohan>Yep.

00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:37.641
 Adam Hollohan>Yep.

00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:42.671
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:44.151
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:20:43.881 --> 00:20:44.101
 Jeff Campbell>So.

00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:45.091
 Adam Hollohan>You know there's.

00:20:45.101 --> 00:20:47.311
 Adam Hollohan>I do like 60 homes a year, so.

00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:47.771
 Jeff Campbell>OK, great.

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:48.881
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:48.031
 Dean Finch>OK.

00:20:50.161 --> 00:20:55.571
 Jeff Campbell>So you can put that customer in there and then you can have multiple job sites associated with that customer as well.

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:56.601
 Adam Hollohan>That.

00:20:57.151 --> 00:21:00.301
 Jeff Campbell>So we've got, you know, as many job sites as you need for a customer.

00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:03.561
 Jeff Campbell>You can have inside of there and you just select one of those or add a new one in.

00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:06.331
 Jeff Campbell>You can always add a new job site inside of there as well.

00:21:07.191 --> 00:21:07.431
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.501
 Jeff Campbell>That'll link you to Google Maps also.

00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:17.881
 Jeff Campbell>So yeah, your texts in the field working in the work order, they can pull that up right from Google Maps also get directions as needed.

00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:24.001
 Jeff Campbell>You don't need a link for that job site address, but it's nice to have if you if you have it.

00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:25.731
 Jeff Campbell>But sometimes new homes.

00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:26.911
 Adam Hollohan>Yes, I agree with the issue of like lots.

00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:28.811
 Adam Hollohan>You know where you guys based on that.

00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:28.581
 Jeff Campbell>Absolutely.

00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:30.071
 Adam Hollohan>Are you guys based out of Canada?

00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:31.721
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, we are.

00:21:31.851 --> 00:21:33.071
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, I'm in Saskatchewan here.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.521
 Adam Hollohan>We'll have.

00:21:34.231 --> 00:21:39.101
 Adam Hollohan>We'll have lots for the new builds and then it turns to a civic once the house is sold.

00:21:39.111 --> 00:21:40.421
 Adam Hollohan>It's kind of confusing here, but.

00:21:41.431 --> 00:21:42.201
 Jeff Campbell>Understandable.

00:21:42.331 --> 00:21:42.631
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:42.801
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:48.111
 Jeff Campbell>And we have a few customers that kind of that that, that deal with the same, the same kind of thing.

00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:43.351
 Dean Finch>So a lot.

00:21:48.121 --> 00:21:48.841
 Jeff Campbell>So you have lots.

00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:55.321
 Jeff Campbell>That don't exactly have like an address on them yet.

00:21:55.711 --> 00:22:00.261
 Jeff Campbell>Is that essentially what you're yeah, yeah.

00:21:57.481 --> 00:21:58.301
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, exactly.

00:21:59.061 --> 00:21:59.471
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:00.731
 Dean Finch>So a lot and block number.

00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:02.121
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, a lot.

00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:05.971
 Adam Hollohan>01 you know, whatever the address is, but OK, so job site address.

00:22:04.681 --> 00:22:05.461
 Dean Finch>Yeah, yeah.

00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:10.221
 Adam Hollohan>Cool you can, you know, reuse the same customer for corporate.

00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:12.171
 Adam Hollohan>You know where their head office is for billing.

00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:12.981
 Adam Hollohan>That's awesome.

00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:16.271
 Adam Hollohan>Is there anywhere in the quote where you can attach PDF's of blueprints?

00:22:16.861 --> 00:22:17.491
 Jeff Campbell>Absolutely.

00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:17.221
 Dean Finch>Yep.

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:18.351
 Jeff Campbell>I'm gonna get there.

00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:19.141
 Jeff Campbell>I'm gonna get there.

00:22:19.801 --> 00:22:25.581
 Dean Finch>One question just before we move on there, Jeff, what do you use for your accounting software right now?

00:22:26.551 --> 00:22:27.331
 Adam Hollohan>Uh sage 50.

00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:31.271
 Dean Finch>Perfect we can.

00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:39.561
 Adam Hollohan>And we use HubSpot for like managing our quotes in the showroom is what is currently hubs.

00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:31.231
 Jeff Campbell>Alright.

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:36.741
 Dean Finch>OK.

00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:38.231
 Jeff Campbell>Use house call.

00:22:38.241 --> 00:22:38.561
 Jeff Campbell>Did you say?

00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.481
 Dean Finch>No HubSpot.

00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:41.381
 Jeff Campbell>Obs.

00:22:41.391 --> 00:22:41.781
 Jeff Campbell>Spot OK.

00:22:41.451 --> 00:22:44.661
 Adam Hollohan>Just for managing our quote, it's like no one like when a kitchen comes in.

00:22:44.671 --> 00:22:45.951
 Adam Hollohan>Like what date did we receive?

00:22:45.961 --> 00:22:46.781
 Adam Hollohan>The blueprint.

00:22:47.371 --> 00:22:54.431
 Adam Hollohan>You know how far it is along the channel of like quote, measure, design, revision sold, you know to like that.

00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:48.141
 Dean Finch>Yep.

00:22:53.061 --> 00:22:56.041
 Dean Finch>Right. Uh.

00:22:55.011 --> 00:23:04.591
 Jeff Campbell>So are you gonna wanna continue to use that or are you going to, are you hoping that you can do that stuff inside of service box like what I'm doing right now?

00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:03.961
 Adam Hollohan>I'm open. I can't.

00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:04.981
 Adam Hollohan>It's not.

00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:07.011
 Jeff Campbell>OK, sure.

00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:05.911
 Adam Hollohan>It's not the world.

00:23:07.051 --> 00:23:07.321
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:10.021
 Jeff Campbell>And I think that you can I, I and.

00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:11.191
 Dean Finch>Yep, I think will HubSpot hub spots more of us.

00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:14.801
 Dean Finch>It's a CRM, so you do follow ups with clients and all that kind of stuff out of HubSpot too.

00:23:16.011 --> 00:23:16.441
 Adam Hollohan>Uh.

00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:22.101
 Adam Hollohan>No, they're just using it for keeping the workflow organized.

00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:19.881
 Dean Finch>No.

00:23:22.771 --> 00:23:23.121
 Dean Finch>OK.

00:23:24.051 --> 00:23:24.721
 Dean Finch>Yeah. OK.

00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:31.871
 Jeff Campbell>So we use statuses inside of these quotes and work orders and invoices to tell which stage they're in.

00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:32.861
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:34.451
 Jeff Campbell>This is all configurable stuff.

00:23:34.461 --> 00:23:36.641
 Jeff Campbell>All this drop down menu stuff here that you're going to see.

00:23:36.741 --> 00:23:37.041
 Jeff Campbell>Uh.

00:23:37.051 --> 00:23:41.011
 Jeff Campbell>Through this uh demonstration today, and I'm gonna say it often.

00:23:41.581 --> 00:23:42.291
 Jeff Campbell>Configurable.

00:23:42.361 --> 00:23:43.251
 Jeff Campbell>You're gonna add to these.

00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:45.331
 Jeff Campbell>You can rename these whatever you'd like.

00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:47.191
 Jeff Campbell>I'm just gonna keep this as a draft for now.

00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:52.571
 Jeff Campbell>I basic quote information scope of work, whatever you want in here.

00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:54.251
 Jeff Campbell>This is gonna pop up and say what you needed to.

00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:57.111
 Jeff Campbell>Maybe you have like a little layout that you want for this stuff.

00:23:56.221 --> 00:23:57.891
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, we do. OK.

00:23:57.381 --> 00:23:57.771
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:23:57.821 --> 00:23:58.241
 Jeff Campbell>Awesome.

00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:02.481
 Jeff Campbell>You can create that and it'll pop up with that layout every time for you.

00:24:02.141 --> 00:24:02.361
 Adam Hollohan>Cool.

00:24:04.561 --> 00:24:07.351
 Jeff Campbell>And this is uh, so you you want to add to it whatever.

00:24:07.361 --> 00:24:08.411
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, you have there.

00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:12.941
 Jeff Campbell>You know any information that you that you have on there and you can edit whatever you need.

00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:17.571
 Jeff Campbell>There you go.

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:21.451
 Jeff Campbell>So we've created the quote and now we can go over to the calculator.

00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:27.011
 Jeff Campbell>Here I'm gonna hit that calculator button and it's gonna bring up our our list of items that we can add in here now.

00:24:27.271 --> 00:24:30.231
 Jeff Campbell>So we've got different price books you might have for different customers.

00:24:30.241 --> 00:24:56.131
 Jeff Campbell>If that's the case, tax levels as well, that tax level is gonna default to whatever you have set for that customer, but you can hit that drop down menu and see, you know, have as many taxes as you as you want to create inside of here to select in Canada where usually not too worried about unless there's a tax exemption of some sort or we're working on a reserve perhaps or perhaps out of province, then maybe your tax levels change, but we're not.

00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:59.351
 Jeff Campbell>It's pretty easy here for the most part.

00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:02.551
 Jeff Campbell>Fixed right prices that you might have.

00:25:02.561 --> 00:25:04.581
 Jeff Campbell>You might have service called charges or something like that.

00:25:04.591 --> 00:25:08.831
 Jeff Campbell>I'm just going to put this in as an example, but you might have some type of fix rate prices that you use.

00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:11.011
 Jeff Campbell>I'm add those in.

00:25:11.021 --> 00:25:18.061
 Jeff Campbell>I'm just gonna add in a service call charge here and as you see I just started typing that in and I thought it it pulled it right up for me.

00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:19.941
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:25:19.781 --> 00:25:24.721
 Jeff Campbell>So labor, you know, however you, you, these are gonna be your items that are inside of here.

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:30.441
 Jeff Campbell>You know, you might have a list of items that you that you use that these are fields of.

00:25:30.511 --> 00:25:33.621
 Jeff Campbell>You can you can customize different fields inside of here as well.

00:25:33.631 --> 00:25:41.941
 Jeff Campbell>For information that you wanna you wanna have items stacked under it, materials that you might use on for.

00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:45.461
 Jeff Campbell>I know that you have drawings in your design stuff and everything like that.

00:25:45.471 --> 00:25:48.151
 Jeff Campbell>You can add those materials inside of here though.

00:25:48.311 --> 00:26:02.091
 Jeff Campbell>However you wanna put them in and as far as descriptions and stuff go, this is very vague right here, but as you see I just started typing cabin cabinet in there and it's automatically pulling up the cabinet that I have inside of here.

00:26:02.141 --> 00:26:11.271
 Jeff Campbell>So you know you have a list of items that you might use inside of here, and it's gonna bring up that latest unit cost that you've had on it that you had last time for it.

00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:16.281
 Jeff Campbell>And we can go and add that in and then we can edit that as well.

00:26:16.291 --> 00:26:18.201
 Jeff Campbell>Hey this has gone up in price.

00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:21.841
 Jeff Campbell>There we go.

00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:28.581
 Jeff Campbell>And you switched that and now moving forward, that item is gonna have that new price on it.

00:26:29.681 --> 00:26:32.591
 Dean Finch>So do you add your appliances and your all your?

00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:38.361
 Dean Finch>I mean, I'm imagining you're applying all your hardware in like all your hinges and handles and all that kind of stuff is going in the quote.

00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:40.751
 Adam Hollohan>Yep.

00:26:41.341 --> 00:26:41.631
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:45.131
 Dean Finch>And then do you do your appliances in the quote at the same time we're?

00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:48.011
 Adam Hollohan>No, we just do at kitchen cabinets we have.

00:26:47.471 --> 00:26:49.691
 Dean Finch>OK, you don't do appliances, OK?

00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:52.461
 Dean Finch>And then standard.

00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:53.571
 Dean Finch>Do you have standard boxes?

00:26:53.861 --> 00:26:55.851
 Dean Finch>Some of your boxes imagine are standard size.

00:26:56.271 --> 00:26:56.441
 Adam Hollohan>What?

00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:57.551
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:26:57.601 --> 00:26:58.481
 Dean Finch>So those could be in here.

00:26:59.561 --> 00:26:59.791
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:27:00.861 --> 00:27:01.591
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, whatever.

00:27:01.601 --> 00:27:07.771
 Jeff Campbell>Whatever items, whatever materials you wanna add in here, you know you can you can have in here, these are your non inventory materials.

00:27:07.781 --> 00:27:13.891
 Jeff Campbell>So if you do wanna track those in your inventory, you can track your inventory inside of service box as well.

00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:16.541
 Jeff Campbell>Is that something that you're looking to do inside of service box?

00:27:18.681 --> 00:27:20.671
 Adam Hollohan>Sorry, I said.

00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:25.011
 Jeff Campbell>Inventory, like your own personal inventory, are you wanting to track that inside of service box?

00:27:26.691 --> 00:27:31.541
 Adam Hollohan>Umm, give me an example like right now we don't, we just do manual counts for inventory.

00:27:31.551 --> 00:27:40.071
 Adam Hollohan>But you know we have, I would say we have at least 1000 line items with different different inventory products.

00:27:32.891 --> 00:27:33.291
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:27:41.481 --> 00:27:43.551
 Jeff Campbell>Sure, you could track that inside of service box.

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.931
 Jeff Campbell>So we have an inventory.

00:27:44.941 --> 00:28:03.691
 Jeff Campbell>Uh umm module inside of here which I can get into a little bit further into the into the demo, but you can also quote on those items as well and maybe it's just that at the beginning you just wanna track stuff that's on your guys trucks, you know or whatever things that they're pulling off the truck or whatever it might be.

00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:07.981
 Jeff Campbell>I'm just gonna quote this item, but you can pull inventory right from a work order as well.

00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:09.041
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:28:09.311 --> 00:28:16.771
 Jeff Campbell>But tracking those you know, anything that you want those thousand line items that you have in your inventory, you can track that inside of service box?

00:28:19.261 --> 00:28:19.551
 Jeff Campbell>Uh.

00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:20.791
 Dean Finch>How do you track inventory today?

00:28:22.661 --> 00:28:23.651
 Dean Finch>But we lost them too.

00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:25.091
 Adam Hollohan>Sorry about that guys.

00:28:24.551 --> 00:28:26.601
 Dean Finch>Ohh, no problem ma'am.

00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:26.051
 Adam Hollohan>OK, I'm back in.

00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:26.031
 Jeff Campbell>That's OK.

00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:28.151
 Dean Finch>I how do you track inventory today?

00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:29.281
 Adam Hollohan>We found that, Yep.

00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:34.511
 Dean Finch>Adam.

00:28:35.391 --> 00:28:35.791
 Adam Hollohan>Yes, sorry.

00:28:36.471 --> 00:28:36.681
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:38.551
 Dean Finch>We just wondering how you track inventory today?

00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:42.971
 Adam Hollohan>This manual adjustments in in our accounting software.

00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:43.941
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, he mentioned that, Dean.

00:28:43.841 --> 00:28:45.471
 Dean Finch>Ohh I didn't, I didn't hear.

00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:46.181
 Dean Finch>I didn't hear it, sorry.

00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:56.531
 Jeff Campbell>So yeah, moving on like you, you can you can track your inventory, you can, you know, and we'll we can talk about that after as well.

00:28:57.421 --> 00:29:01.851
 Jeff Campbell>Sorry for breaking that flow here, but it is an option inside of here.

00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:15.021
 Jeff Campbell>So however you wanna quote these materials and these items, there's several ways that we can do that inside of service box attachments like you said, asking if we can add a PDF or anything like that to the quote.

00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:15.661
 Jeff Campbell>Of course we can.

00:29:16.001 --> 00:29:24.231
 Jeff Campbell>We can choose files from, you know your dog uploading from your desktop or a device that you're using.

00:29:24.381 --> 00:29:26.701
 Jeff Campbell>Dropbox are URL link of some sort.

00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:33.391
 Jeff Campbell>You can also take picture and video right inside the app as well, so there's a camera icon inside the app.

00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:34.811
 Jeff Campbell>You can take snapshots and video.

00:29:35.201 --> 00:29:39.531
 Jeff Campbell>Maybe when you're quoting you wanna take a before picture of the room or something like that.

00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:46.891
 Jeff Campbell>You can have all that uploaded in the quote as well, or just uh, you know, select a PDF files, some sort.

00:29:43.411 --> 00:29:43.701
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:51.921
 Jeff Campbell>There we go.

00:29:52.011 --> 00:29:53.881
 Jeff Campbell>And then we can email that out to the customer.

00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:58.901
 Jeff Campbell>So taking a look at what we're sending off here, you can show breakdown stuff.

00:29:58.911 --> 00:30:03.461
 Jeff Campbell>Maybe you just have like a package of of what this is going to cost from the design.

00:30:03.711 --> 00:30:21.141
 Jeff Campbell>You know, I I imagine that this layout you know inside the description and things like that is going to be, you know, a little bit different, but you might even have the blueprint attached to this quote as well, which I your logo here, your company information, everything like that, I'm showing a breakdown of these items.

00:30:21.211 --> 00:30:22.541
 Jeff Campbell>You don't need to show that.

00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:29.401
 Jeff Campbell>Here's a good example of me just showing an item without any type of unit cost or quantity or total or anything like that.

00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:36.091
 Jeff Campbell>This is configurable on what you show the customer, so if you don't wanna show the unit costs you just wanna show the quantity and the total, that's fine.

00:30:36.211 --> 00:30:37.401
 Jeff Campbell>You just want to show the quantity.

00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:38.361
 Jeff Campbell>You get the idea.

00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:46.961
 Jeff Campbell>It's totally configurable and then whatever other items you might have here O and then your total at the bottom.

00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:48.381
 Jeff Campbell>Any other closing wording?

00:30:48.391 --> 00:30:53.371
 Jeff Campbell>You want prices valid for a certain amount of days, and then whatever attachments you might send with that as well.

00:30:53.931 --> 00:31:05.771
 Jeff Campbell>So these might be blueprints, they might be, you know, just a PDF file, multiple PDF files of some sort, pictures, video, whatever you'd like to attach to that, and then you can send it off.

00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:03.381
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:10.681
 Jeff Campbell>Now you might get that approved in the field.

00:31:10.951 --> 00:31:11.541
 Jeff Campbell>Perhaps.

00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:15.441
 Jeff Campbell>Maybe you're you're with the customer in the field and you want this approved in in person.

00:31:16.111 --> 00:31:16.731
 Jeff Campbell>That's great.

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:27.001
 Jeff Campbell>You can go and change that to awarded or approved inside of here and then you can get that signed by the customer, but they can also do that from the email that you sent off to them.

00:31:28.311 --> 00:31:36.771
 Jeff Campbell>So if uh, if you sent that email off, they can digitally sign in, approve that from the email, it gets sent back to you in the form of A to do inside service box.

00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:47.321
 Jeff Campbell>And you also get an email alert as well linking you right back to the quote with that status automatically changed to awarded or approved, and that customer signature there.

00:31:48.421 --> 00:31:49.451
 Adam Hollohan>OK, that's kinda cool.

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:51.651
 Jeff Campbell>Awesome. So.

00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:55.401
 Adam Hollohan>Three, we send out like a Adobe DocuSign right now from sign off on every.

00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:56.991
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:31:57.061 --> 00:32:03.621
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, kind of the same thing, except it's all kind of attached to your, to your, to your main system though, right?

00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:04.691
 Adam Hollohan>Right. OK.

00:32:06.361 --> 00:32:08.871
 Jeff Campbell>And and so from here.

00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:10.261
 Jeff Campbell>Now you can create a work order.

00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:17.831
 Jeff Campbell>All we have to do to do that, we've got everything set up in the in the, in the, in the quote.

00:32:17.881 --> 00:32:19.981
 Jeff Campbell>So it's gonna carry all over into the workorder.

00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:22.321
 Jeff Campbell>I'm just going to click on this blue create work order here.

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:31.501
 Jeff Campbell>It's gonna ask me if I wanna add the attachments from the quote and I'll say Yep, whatever attachments you have there now, we've got a quote created.

00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:32.201
 Jeff Campbell>Alright.

00:32:32.241 --> 00:32:35.841
 Jeff Campbell>Pardon me at work order created, we can go and assign this to somebody.

00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:42.001
 Jeff Campbell>Now this assigned to is, you know the the person.

00:32:42.011 --> 00:32:49.651
 Jeff Campbell>You kind of want in charge of this job, so it could be an office administrator dispatcher.

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:53.711
 Jeff Campbell>Someone at the beginning that you you want more in charge of this work order?

00:32:53.821 --> 00:32:55.411
 Jeff Campbell>It doesn't necessarily have to be.

00:32:55.421 --> 00:32:57.611
 Jeff Campbell>I guess what I'm saying is that it doesn't have to be any.

00:32:57.681 --> 00:33:05.401
 Jeff Campbell>Anybody that is actually scheduled to the work that's actually doing the work out in the field, you can schedule as many people to a job as you need to.

00:33:06.541 --> 00:33:06.741
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:33:12.911 --> 00:33:14.611
 Jeff Campbell>Terrible stuff will keep that on scheduled.

00:33:14.911 --> 00:33:24.281
 Jeff Campbell>Another way of breaking up your work inside of service box your different types of work that you do and maybe you have a few different things that you wanna put inside of here.

00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:27.701
 Jeff Campbell>Umm, this is all configurable as well, so add to these.

00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:28.871
 Jeff Campbell>Rename these whatever you'd like.

00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:38.041
 Jeff Campbell>I'm just going to call this simple installation work, but up here you got your work orders, your types of work orders below there and you can color code all those however you'd like as well, umm.

00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:41.691
 Jeff Campbell>And that color code will actually show up in the scheduler, which I'll get to also.

00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:51.721
 Jeff Campbell>I'm sending off notifications to your customers letting them know that you're on your way day before notifications that you can have in here.

00:33:51.971 --> 00:33:59.551
 Jeff Campbell>Those can be sent out with via email or via SMS text message.

00:34:01.211 --> 00:34:07.451
 Jeff Campbell>If you're using SMS text messages for these customer notifications, there is an extra charge per month.

00:34:07.531 --> 00:34:12.501
 Jeff Campbell>It's an extra $10 charge and you get up to 200 text messages in total inside of service box.

00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:15.521
 Jeff Campbell>Umm do you pay another $5?

00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:29.571
 Jeff Campbell>You get another 200 inside of there, so that that's only if you're wanting to use SMS text messages for those notifications that you'd have to pay a little bit, you give that $10.00 per month emails free though, so you don't have to worry about that.

00:34:25.891 --> 00:34:26.271
 Adam Hollohan>No problem.

00:34:30.991 --> 00:34:33.571
 Jeff Campbell>So any email notifications are no charge.

00:34:34.831 --> 00:34:38.561
 Jeff Campbell>Anything you require your text to do on a job, you can make a requirement.

00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:48.101
 Jeff Campbell>So if there's stuff that you wanna make sure that everybody gets done before they complete a work order before they close, that you can make that, uh, a mandatory thing inside of here.

00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:49.881
 Jeff Campbell>These are some custom fields down here.

00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:57.081
 Jeff Campbell>I've read starred this item here Mark saying like I need that information before you can close this work order.

00:34:57.211 --> 00:35:05.751
 Jeff Campbell>We're gonna get into things here like checklists as well, which you can have as a mandatory item inside of here.

00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:08.251
 Jeff Campbell>Add certain amount of the images that you need them.

00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:19.871
 Jeff Campbell>That you require them to take before they can close the work order, whatever it is that you require, you can make that requirement and inside of here as you see in the materials, we've got everything that we have inside of there.

00:35:19.981 --> 00:35:24.571
 Jeff Campbell>I'm gonna add the inventory so this is asking me if I wanna add the inventory from quote.

00:35:24.641 --> 00:35:27.571
 Jeff Campbell>And so I'm from the quote, and I'm gonna pull that.

00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:30.641
 Jeff Campbell>We can see where all that stuff's allocated.

00:35:31.001 --> 00:35:34.461
 Jeff Campbell>We've got this many in the warehouse, this many in vehicle one vehicle 2, vehicle three.

00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:43.321
 Jeff Campbell>These might be bin locations for you if you you know if you've got that stuff, however you wanna track your inventory inside of yours, you can just pull it from whatever location.

00:35:43.331 --> 00:35:44.941
 Jeff Campbell>Hey, I'm gonna take these from vehicle too.

00:35:46.661 --> 00:35:48.591
 Jeff Campbell>There you go and it pulls that from vehicle 2.

00:35:52.551 --> 00:35:55.631
 Jeff Campbell>So it'll pull that right out of the inventory checklist.

00:35:56.241 --> 00:36:03.741
 Jeff Campbell>Again, you wanna add a checklist in here, these you know, whatever types of checklists you wanna put together inside of here to make sure that your text complete things.

00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:05.881
 Jeff Campbell>These are premade checklists that you can make.

00:36:05.931 --> 00:36:10.071
 Jeff Campbell>We've got all types of templates to create these, and you can add to these as well.

00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:14.281
 Jeff Campbell>Hey I need you to do this and I need you to check this as well.

00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:17.761
 Jeff Campbell>On top of all the other items that they have there.

00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:16.171
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:25.221
 Jeff Campbell>Anything else that you need to add in that you wanna, you know that you wanna.

00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:30.971
 Jeff Campbell>You know, reminders to do is you can send out to DOS to remind text to pick up materials and things like that.

00:36:31.541 --> 00:36:32.061
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:35.231
 Jeff Campbell>And they'll get alerts on their phone and email.

00:36:35.721 --> 00:36:37.891
 Jeff Campbell>But you know, scheduling simple you can.

00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:39.261
 Jeff Campbell>There's a couple ways we can do that.

00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:43.371
 Jeff Campbell>We can hit the schedule button, we can add users one by one from here.

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.111
 Jeff Campbell>But the start time in put the end time in.

00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:45.611
 Jeff Campbell>Check it off.

00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:46.601
 Jeff Campbell>They'll go into the scheduler.

00:36:48.021 --> 00:37:01.131
 Jeff Campbell>You can also create user groups, so if you have different trucks, different departments or just cruise, you can create user groups and have and it will automatically schedule everybody from that group into the scheduler.

00:37:01.301 --> 00:37:03.571
 Jeff Campbell>We can also open the scheduler up like this.

00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:12.211
 Jeff Campbell>And that's gonna.

00:37:12.221 --> 00:37:13.731
 Jeff Campbell>I just typed in the work order number.

00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:26.151
 Jeff Campbell>There we can also go and look through all unscheduled work orders if we want and drag and drop, but I just went and searched that work order number and I'm gonna drag and drop that over and let's say this is an all day job for tomorrow or something like that.

00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:27.351
 Jeff Campbell>You could schedule like that.

00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:46.821
 Jeff Campbell>Maybe this is a job that you're just going out to today to to complete really quickly, you know, and we were just we want to be there by whatever time 10:00 AM and it's gonna take a couple hours we can go and schedule John to that as well and we can schedule lead to that also.

00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:52.351
 Jeff Campbell>So that's just a that's quick job that we might do.

00:37:52.361 --> 00:37:54.641
 Jeff Campbell>We can drag this down as well. Oops.

00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:57.701
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:57.871
 Jeff Campbell>You know.

00:37:57.711 --> 00:38:02.321
 Adam Hollohan>So that's all your tax on Thursday, September.

00:38:04.161 --> 00:38:04.741
 Adam Hollohan>7th.

00:38:05.281 --> 00:38:05.871
 Jeff Campbell>Correct.

00:38:05.981 --> 00:38:08.491
 Jeff Campbell>Yes, this at all your texts you're seeing each bracket.

00:38:08.501 --> 00:38:12.691
 Jeff Campbell>Each tech that you have there and what they're doing for Thursday, awesome.

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:12.251
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, I like that, yeah.

00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:16.691
 Jeff Campbell>And so all day jobs will show up here like this.

00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:17.961
 Jeff Campbell>And so these are just jobs.

00:38:17.231 --> 00:38:17.511
 Adam Hollohan>Right.

00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:20.831
 Jeff Campbell>They're gonna be there all day, and maybe they're there for the whole week.

00:38:20.921 --> 00:38:24.261
 Jeff Campbell>And so they just check into that job every day, right? That's.

00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:21.491
 Adam Hollohan>Yep.

00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:25.001
 Adam Hollohan>But how do you make the full?

00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:26.031
 Adam Hollohan>How do you make it a full week?

00:38:27.761 --> 00:38:35.311
 Jeff Campbell>So you could just go and when you're like, if I went up here and we moved these up to all day.

00:38:37.671 --> 00:38:39.341
 Jeff Campbell>We can take go into that work order.

00:38:40.681 --> 00:38:45.701
 Jeff Campbell>Just going to pardon me, there's a couple ways we could we could could have done this.

00:38:45.711 --> 00:38:52.261
 Jeff Campbell>I could have gone to the weekly view as well inside of here and just drag those over like that.

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:53.341
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:38:53.261 --> 00:39:03.061
 Jeff Campbell>There's a couple ways that we can do this, but I'm actually going to go into the work order and you can just edit these and say that these are for from today until next week.

00:38:55.491 --> 00:38:55.611
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:04.481
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:39:04.701 --> 00:39:06.791
 Dean Finch>I'm some of your kitchen jobs.

00:39:05.151 --> 00:39:05.651
 Jeff Campbell>Just like that.

00:39:06.801 --> 00:39:09.931
 Dean Finch>Take more than a day to there for a few days.

00:39:08.731 --> 00:39:11.801
 Adam Hollohan>Two days all itself for today.

00:39:09.091 --> 00:39:10.931
 Jeff Campbell>For sure, I would imagine so, yeah.

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:13.261
 Dean Finch>Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.

00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:28.081
 Jeff Campbell>So you know that a couple ways that you can do that simple and easy from here as well or in the OR in the weekly view of the scheduler, you can just pull those over O you can actually click on those and switch them from inside the scheduler as well.

00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:31.361
 Jeff Campbell>So there's like multiple ways that you can do that.

00:39:28.831 --> 00:39:30.101
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, yeah, that was.

00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:32.151
 Jeff Campbell>Multiple views.

00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:34.801
 Jeff Campbell>You can do that in, umm and then.

00:39:34.161 --> 00:39:43.941
 Adam Hollohan>So so say we receive a work order and it came down today and we're not going to do the job until third week of October.

00:39:38.061 --> 00:39:38.291
 Jeff Campbell>Yep.

00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:48.611
 Adam Hollohan>Do you physically like get it on your upcoming schedule or calendar?

00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:50.101
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:39:50.111 --> 00:39:52.621
 Jeff Campbell>So you would just like inside the work order.

00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:55.181
 Jeff Campbell>We could have done that from this one, right?

00:39:55.191 --> 00:39:59.841
 Jeff Campbell>We are you saying that it's are you not scheduling anybody yet?

00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:00.741
 Adam Hollohan>No.

00:40:01.851 --> 00:40:02.281
 Jeff Campbell>No.

00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:03.301
 Jeff Campbell>OK, so.

00:40:03.011 --> 00:40:18.791
 Adam Hollohan>So John comes down and we we make communication with the client to say like, hey, this is our production timeline, but we're also asking our clients if they're billed, it's going to be ready when the kitchens ready to ship.

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:27.921
 Adam Hollohan>So, like right now, everything's pretty much 8 weeks out unless the customer says, hey, how Are you ready sooner or be they need more time.

00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:33.511
 Adam Hollohan>Right, so every job comes down, Banana walked on the calendar 8 weeks out.

00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:32.341
 Jeff Campbell>But you want to put that on the calendar though for sure to.

00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:37.861
 Jeff Campbell>And but not necessarily scheduled to anybody.

00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:44.561
 Jeff Campbell>So what I would do is I would pick somebody from the office and schedule them to that job.

00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:38.791
 Adam Hollohan>That's correct.

00:40:44.621 --> 00:40:49.831
 Jeff Campbell>If you want it on the on the on the actual calendar, just schedule somebody to it tentatively.

00:40:50.251 --> 00:40:50.601
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:52.671
 Jeff Campbell>And so that it's on the calendar.

00:40:53.621 --> 00:40:59.661
 Jeff Campbell>Otherwise you can create work orders and just keep them on scheduled and have a list of work orders of unscheduled work that's coming up right.

00:40:58.481 --> 00:40:58.901
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:40:58.911 --> 00:41:02.391
 Adam Hollohan>So stay tuned on scheduled work order that we don't have anyone to.

00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:01.381
 Jeff Campbell>Ohh yeah.

00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:03.371
 Adam Hollohan>How does that work?

00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:04.721
 Jeff Campbell>Absolutely yeah so.

00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:08.011
 Dean Finch>But it won't it, but the unscheduled ones wouldn't be on the calendar.

00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:09.461
 Dean Finch>Jeff was just giving you an option to get.

00:41:08.131 --> 00:41:09.141
 Jeff Campbell>They won't be on the com.

00:41:10.191 --> 00:41:10.661
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:41:10.671 --> 00:41:23.461
 Jeff Campbell>I I'm just saying that those those the list of unscheduled work orders won't actually show up on the calendar because if it's if it's unless you're scheduling that job, it's not gonna show up on the calendar, right?

00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:40.401
 Jeff Campbell>So inside of here your work orders, you can have a list of work orders and you can look at all your statuses and look at all of your unscheduled work, and you can break that up by installation jobs you know by whatever types of work that you have.

00:41:40.411 --> 00:41:44.111
 Jeff Campbell>You can break that stuff up or just look at all all work orders.

00:41:47.231 --> 00:41:50.561
 Jeff Campbell>And so here's your list of like unscheduled work orders, right?

00:41:50.851 --> 00:41:57.731
 Jeff Campbell>However, you wanna you want to break that up, but they're these aren't going to be unless you've actually scheduled them to somebody.

00:41:58.121 --> 00:42:00.071
 Jeff Campbell>They're not actually gonna show up on the calendar.

00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:07.131
 Jeff Campbell>So what I'm thinking is that either you have like a an option just an open seat to.

00:42:09.101 --> 00:42:22.461
 Jeff Campbell>You know, a tentative seed or something like that that you that you create inside of here or just use somebody from the office and just schedule them to that job until you're ready to actually schedule a technician to it.

00:42:20.841 --> 00:42:22.951
 Adam Hollohan>OK, so let's make it 1 regular.

00:42:22.961 --> 00:42:29.651
 Adam Hollohan>So basically like it could be just in the template like unassigned installer or tent tent to the smaller.

00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:28.971
 Jeff Campbell>Exactly.

00:42:30.121 --> 00:42:31.011
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, you would it would.

00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:32.181
 Adam Hollohan>So up down side of.

00:42:31.021 --> 00:42:35.501
 Jeff Campbell>They would basically be almost like a user ohm that you would have in.

00:42:33.911 --> 00:42:34.301
 Adam Hollohan>Right.

00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:37.731
 Adam Hollohan>So let me see how that will work on the monthly calendar view.

00:42:39.001 --> 00:42:40.441
 Adam Hollohan>It was like that's how we check our jobs.

00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:44.151
 Adam Hollohan>Like it's it's simple like if I'm booking two months in advance.

00:42:44.201 --> 00:42:52.571
 Adam Hollohan>If we have more than 12 jobs in that week, we have to push, you know, upcoming jobs that we put in, gotta go in the next week.

00:42:50.341 --> 00:42:50.641
 Jeff Campbell>Totally.

00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:53.871
 Adam Hollohan>It's it's really simple for us.

00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:55.671
 Jeff Campbell>Absolutely.

00:42:55.721 --> 00:42:57.791
 Jeff Campbell>And so you can look at the month in advance.

00:42:57.801 --> 00:42:58.431
 Jeff Campbell>I I went.

00:42:58.441 --> 00:43:15.951
 Jeff Campbell>I I hit this toggle mode here so to go into a weekly view, but we can also see a day view from this view in a month view as well, and so you're month in advance shows upcoming stuff throughout each month that you can look and so you can schedule those and that's how they're going to look.

00:43:11.981 --> 00:43:12.301
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:43:15.961 --> 00:43:21.721
 Jeff Campbell>You schedule something, it's gonna go in there for for that day in October or in November.

00:43:22.571 --> 00:43:22.851
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:43:23.741 --> 00:43:25.371
 Jeff Campbell>Inside of there, does that make sense?

00:43:25.381 --> 00:43:26.281
 Jeff Campbell>Does that work for you?

00:43:28.921 --> 00:43:32.801
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, I'm just trying to like, think about how relates what we're currently currently doing.

00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:37.951
 Adam Hollohan>But yeah, I think that I'll have to play around with that a little bit, but yeah, OK.

00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:38.171
 Adam Hollohan>I'm.

00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:38.351
 Adam Hollohan>I'm.

00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:38.921
 Adam Hollohan>I'm catching you.

00:43:39.931 --> 00:43:48.681
 Jeff Campbell>For sure we have, like you know, we have our team has multiple ways of of putting this together for you and we'll help you with that getting you set up.

00:43:48.691 --> 00:43:53.601
 Jeff Campbell>And so with what you're doing now, O is this quite a bit different?

00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:55.841
 Jeff Campbell>Is it like I wanna make sure that this is?

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:58.631
 Adam Hollohan>It's pretty similar.

00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:10.571
 Adam Hollohan>The only difference is we we have a delivery calendar, we have an installation calendar and we have a service calendar that we kind of combine all in one calendar to view it pretty quick.

00:44:07.421 --> 00:44:07.661
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:44:12.101 --> 00:44:12.361
 Jeff Campbell>So.

00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:17.451
 Jeff Campbell>So you they're not separate calendars, then they're all combined.

00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.631
 Adam Hollohan>They're different headings in Google, so like deliveries, blue.

00:44:21.661 --> 00:44:28.291
 Adam Hollohan>So someone goes on our or or or calendar for the whole production team and they see a blue icon.

00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:29.511
 Adam Hollohan>They know that's a delivery.

00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:30.701
 Adam Hollohan>They see a green.

00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:30.501
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:44:30.511 --> 00:44:32.671
 Jeff Campbell>So that would be like your category here.

00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:35.451
 Jeff Campbell>And sorry to interrupt you, but that would be your category here.

00:44:33.251 --> 00:44:33.411
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:36.791
 Jeff Campbell>So that's strip of green here.

00:44:37.001 --> 00:44:39.811
 Jeff Campbell>That's that category that we were choosing inside the work order.

00:44:39.941 --> 00:44:42.471
 Jeff Campbell>So you wanna call those delivery work orders?

00:44:40.521 --> 00:44:40.791
 Adam Hollohan>But.

00:44:42.711 --> 00:44:45.931
 Jeff Campbell>It would show up as blue inside of here, so you know it's delivery.

00:44:45.671 --> 00:44:45.871
 Adam Hollohan>Yep.

00:44:50.991 --> 00:44:51.691
 Jeff Campbell>Does that make sense?

00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:52.561
 Adam Hollohan>Yep.

00:44:52.521 --> 00:44:53.271
 Jeff Campbell>Zach, can what?

00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:53.891
 Jeff Campbell>You're getting it.

00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:56.281
 Jeff Campbell>OK, awesome.

00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:54.941
 Adam Hollohan>That'll work.

00:44:57.441 --> 00:45:00.011
 Adam Hollohan>Can you make the icon smaller on the counter view?

00:45:02.261 --> 00:45:04.721
 Jeff Campbell>These icons like that.

00:45:07.851 --> 00:45:08.661
 Jeff Campbell>Sorry, what was that again?

00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.291
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:18.361
 Adam Hollohan>So like you say, if I'm skipping in advance safe, we have five jobs and say like the first week of October, we have five jobs going out every single day.

00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:24.621
 Adam Hollohan>Is there a way that I can actually physically see those work order numbers for five jobs on the calendar view?

00:45:26.561 --> 00:45:26.991
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:45:28.871 --> 00:45:33.381
 Jeff Campbell>If I hit the toggle mode, you can open that up and you can see the work order number there.

00:45:33.771 --> 00:45:36.211
 Jeff Campbell>You have to just click on it to see the work order number.

00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:40.331
 Adam Hollohan>OK, I have to send you a picture.

00:45:40.401 --> 00:45:44.801
 Adam Hollohan>There's basically like I'm looking for a solution that's very similar to what we're using now, because it works.

00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:51.831
 Adam Hollohan>But to be able to scale a little bit easier and have better access to information.

00:45:54.891 --> 00:45:55.351
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:45:57.541 --> 00:45:57.801
 Dean Finch>Yeah.

00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:58.091
 Jeff Campbell>So one.

00:45:57.811 --> 00:46:00.951
 Dean Finch>So you're more you're so it's the, it's the, it's the.

00:46:01.481 --> 00:46:02.891
 Dean Finch>So it's how it looks.

00:46:02.901 --> 00:46:08.141
 Dean Finch>It's visually it's easy for you to understand where everyone's at based on how that looks in Google Calendar.

00:46:06.291 --> 00:46:06.491
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:46:09.171 --> 00:46:13.001
 Dean Finch>OK, if you could send if you could send that a screenshot of that over to Jeff, that'd be great.

00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:14.261
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, that would be awesome.

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:29.401
 Jeff Campbell>And then there's a couple ways that we've had customers that want to see easier access to those work order numbers that we've kind of worked with to, you know, either add them into before like I mean.

00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:37.011
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, it's probably the best way to do that is just the click on it and see that work order number.

00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:39.901
 Jeff Campbell>But you're wanting that to display like, right on?

00:46:41.021 --> 00:46:45.271
 Adam Hollohan>I'm sure there's ways around it, I just gotta show you what we're currently working with.

00:46:44.531 --> 00:46:44.831
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:46.451
 Adam Hollohan>I'm sure you'd be like.

00:46:46.461 --> 00:46:48.651
 Adam Hollohan>Ohh yeah, we can just you know.

00:46:48.441 --> 00:46:49.691
 Jeff Campbell>Well, do you want to show me right now?

00:46:49.701 --> 00:46:50.641
 Jeff Campbell>Do you want to share your screen?

00:46:52.251 --> 00:46:53.251
 Dean Finch>I'll let you guys do that.

00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:52.601
 Adam Hollohan>I had a.

00:46:53.261 --> 00:46:53.671
 Dean Finch>I've got.

00:46:53.721 --> 00:46:55.671
 Dean Finch>I've got a hard stop here.

00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:56.751
 Dean Finch>I've gotta jump to a meeting.

00:46:56.761 --> 00:47:00.301
 Dean Finch>So they're like nice meeting you, Adam.

00:46:57.351 --> 00:46:57.771
 Adam Hollohan>No problem.

00:46:57.851 --> 00:46:58.261
 Jeff Campbell>OK.

00:46:58.311 --> 00:46:58.651
 Jeff Campbell>Bye, Dean.

00:46:59.751 --> 00:46:59.931
 Adam Hollohan>Right.

00:47:00.491 --> 00:47:00.811
 Dean Finch>Take care.

00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:01.091
 Adam Hollohan>You too.

00:47:03.311 --> 00:47:04.731
 Adam Hollohan>How do I share my screen brother?

00:47:05.131 --> 00:47:05.661
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:13.271
 Jeff Campbell>So I'm gonna stop here, and then the there's a beside the leave button there there's a share icon.

00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:12.301
 Adam Hollohan>Cool.

00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:14.481
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:23.681
 Adam Hollohan>Alright, select the tab is share.

00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:28.851
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, I want to share my window, OK.

00:47:33.961 --> 00:47:34.711
 Adam Hollohan>You see in this, Jeff.

00:47:35.221 --> 00:47:36.041
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, I'm seeing it.

00:47:36.831 --> 00:47:37.671
 Adam Hollohan>OK so.

00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:45.471
 Adam Hollohan>Currently, a job is sent down to the shop and today is September 7th.

00:47:46.621 --> 00:47:52.291
 Adam Hollohan>So you can see how it physically have all these jobs that are upcoming that we have to.

00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:55.621
 Adam Hollohan>These are all tentative dates that firmed up.

00:47:54.961 --> 00:47:55.141
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:47:57.311 --> 00:48:04.201
 Adam Hollohan>The green is that clients ready sooner or their production or their stage of their homes going a lot quicker than anticipated.

00:48:05.131 --> 00:48:10.451
 Adam Hollohan>So if we have a client to move out of the week of the 18th that they have a delay, we can move that one out.

00:48:12.531 --> 00:48:17.881
 Adam Hollohan>So right now we don't have any delivery slots because we haven't confirmed the delivery time.

 Adam Hollohan>The week of the 16th to 20th.

00:48:30.151 --> 00:48:31.401
 Adam Hollohan>That's an overbooked week.

00:48:32.101 --> 00:48:34.951

00:48:42.051 --> 00:48:42.891
 Adam Hollohan>So way to do that.

00:48:50.691 --> 00:48:50.911
 Jeff Campbell>So.

00:48:54.261 --> 00:49:00.171
 Jeff Campbell>Like the what I was showing you wasn't the same then as that or like with the upcoming jobs.

00:48:59.181 --> 00:49:04.281
 Adam Hollohan>Ohh, I'd just couldn't see because many icons like OK so like right here.

00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:05.661

00:49:05.671 --> 00:49:09.421
 Adam Hollohan>See how I can just drag those jobs right?

00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:07.871
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

00:49:09.481 --> 00:49:18.751
 Adam Hollohan>And I can see on the 13th, without going into weak view, I can see 123456 jobs.

00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:21.161
 Jeff Campbell>All for sure.

00:49:21.201 --> 00:49:24.251
 Jeff Campbell>So like the month in advance like I was like I was showing you there.

00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:23.431
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah.

00:49:24.301 --> 00:49:25.471

 Jeff Campbell>And he like the but you and.

00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:34.011
 Jeff Campbell>And I know you said you wanted those those to be smaller, I think and I think there's a couple ways that we can do that.

00:49:34.021 --> 00:49:36.561
 Jeff Campbell>But here if I I'm just gonna share my screen again here.

00:49:36.771 --> 00:49:37.391
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, sure.

00:49:37.531 --> 00:49:44.941
 Jeff Campbell>So in that month view that we were looking at that like those upcoming jobs, that's exactly how that would look.

00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:46.961
 Jeff Campbell>So that's the 4th, right?

00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:50.281
 Jeff Campbell>This is Monday, September 4th.

00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:55.871
 Jeff Campbell>If I go into sorry into the next month, you can see those jobs for the 30th.

00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:57.191
 Jeff Campbell>There's 123.

00:49:58.631 --> 00:50:01.331
 Jeff Campbell>These are just colored the same because they're the same.

00:50:02.001 --> 00:50:03.461
 Jeff Campbell>Therefore the same person.

00:50:02.641 --> 00:50:04.831
 Adam Hollohan>Are you 6 jobs on the 30th?

00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:05.661
 Adam Hollohan>Let me see how that looks.

00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:08.501
 Jeff Campbell>What's that? Sorry.

00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:13.541
 Adam Hollohan>Place so right now you have three work orders on the date of the 30th.

00:50:17.991 --> 00:50:18.571
 Jeff Campbell>There's five.

00:50:18.941 --> 00:50:20.361
 Adam Hollohan>OK, it'll just keep shrinking up.

00:50:20.371 --> 00:50:20.601
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:50:20.611 --> 00:50:20.871
 Adam Hollohan>Perfect.

00:50:20.901 --> 00:50:21.901
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:21.961 --> 00:50:22.311
 Adam Hollohan>Awesome.

00:50:22.501 --> 00:50:22.991
 Adam Hollohan>OK, cool.

00:50:24.531 --> 00:50:24.851
 Jeff Campbell>Perfect.

00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:25.761
 Adam Hollohan>That worked for me.

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:27.801
 Jeff Campbell>Awesome.

00:50:27.851 --> 00:50:29.341
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, I'm glad we were able to cover that.

00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.491
 Jeff Campbell>Uh, thanks for showing me that.

00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:34.661
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah, I I wasn't grasping it at 1st and I probably should have.

00:50:34.841 --> 00:50:39.161
 Jeff Campbell>So my apologies, they absolutely, absolutely.

00:50:35.231 --> 00:50:35.811
 Adam Hollohan>That's OK.

00:50:35.821 --> 00:50:37.441
 Adam Hollohan>Pretty hard to explain right so.

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:42.621
 Jeff Campbell>Alright, that's that's perfect.

00:50:42.631 --> 00:50:45.001
 Jeff Campbell>So you know when a job is scheduled.

00:50:47.291 --> 00:50:48.001
 Jeff Campbell>You have.

00:50:52.241 --> 00:50:54.591
 Jeff Campbell>You know you're you're text gonna get scheduled to it.

00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:59.451
 Jeff Campbell>Whatever it might be, you know for that day or whatever.

00:50:59.461 --> 00:51:03.391
 Jeff Campbell>And so when they're in that when they go to that job, I'm gonna get out of this calendar here.

00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:04.771
 Jeff Campbell>We're gonna go into the work order.

00:51:03.791 --> 00:51:04.371
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, that's fine.

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:11.491
 Jeff Campbell>So when you're tech opens up their app for the day, they're gonna see their jobs and probably likely they're all day jobs.

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.971
 Jeff Campbell>So they're not even gonna worry about these.

00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:20.141
 Jeff Campbell>But maybe you do have some service calls that you need to send them out on during the day, and if that's the case, you can go into the work order and say hey.

00:51:23.461 --> 00:51:31.591
 Jeff Campbell>You know, Jeff, at 12:00 o'clock today, I need you to go and run out and go and check this job site and go and make sure everything is all good there.

00:51:31.901 --> 00:51:39.651
 Jeff Campbell>You know, I could just quickly just create a quick work order, put the description in and and schedule it to whoever at that time.

00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:46.061
 Jeff Campbell>So if they do have other jobs that they need to get to during the day, those will show up down here, obviously in the time slot.

00:51:47.081 --> 00:51:51.771
 Jeff Campbell>Umm, but typically you know your tech opens up their their app and they see this.

00:51:51.781 --> 00:51:53.951
 Jeff Campbell>Obviously an app mode not in browser mode.

00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:58.041
 Jeff Campbell>If I blow this up, you kind of get an idea of what that looks like inside of the app.

00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:03.071
 Jeff Campbell>You know, this is a blown up version of the browser, but you you get the idea.

00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:11.751
 Jeff Campbell>Obviously it's cleaner inside the app as well, but yeah, so they'll click on that job that they have that opens up the work order for you, and now I can check in.

00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:17.081
 Jeff Campbell>So once they're checked into that job, it's tracking their time from check in to check out.

00:52:17.191 --> 00:52:18.381
 Jeff Campbell>It's gonna take their time.

00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:23.001
 Jeff Campbell>Put that into their timesheet and also put that into their time and materials as well for you to bill out.

00:52:23.621 --> 00:52:24.631
 Jeff Campbell>Umm, you know?

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:33.741
 Jeff Campbell>So it'll track their time right into their timesheet also, but also once they're checked in you can see them on the map so you know where they're checked into.

00:52:35.301 --> 00:52:42.871
 Jeff Campbell>And you know that they're over, you know, on Lorne St here and not over at Leopold's Tavern down here having a pint or something like that in the afternoon.

00:52:42.881 --> 00:52:44.971
 Jeff Campbell>Not that your texts would do something like that, but.

00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:54.741
 Jeff Campbell>Umm, you can hit that toggle mode here as well and I can go and click on Scott and it'll show that Scott's moved, you know?

00:52:54.811 --> 00:53:04.461
 Jeff Campbell>So that's where Scott checked into first, and then he checked into here next, you know, wherever else he checks into, it's gonna draw that line to where he went through throughout the day.

00:53:05.351 --> 00:53:14.161
 Jeff Campbell>If he just moved to go to Starbucks to get a coffee, it'll just draw the line to Starbucks and then came back here and this is using the phone, right?

00:53:14.511 --> 00:53:16.991
 Jeff Campbell>This is using their phone for the location.

00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:19.751
 Jeff Campbell>Or device that they're using.

00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:23.091
 Jeff Campbell>This is an option that you can use.

00:53:23.101 --> 00:53:25.191
 Jeff Campbell>You don't have to use this stuff, but it's nice to.

00:53:25.601 --> 00:53:27.171
 Jeff Campbell>It's nice to have, you know you can.

00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:32.381
 Jeff Campbell>You can report on this as well inside the work order you can you can look at the events tab.

00:53:32.421 --> 00:53:35.971
 Jeff Campbell>See where all the status changes happened?

00:53:36.021 --> 00:53:38.141
 Jeff Campbell>Check-ins and things like that inside of there as well.

00:53:42.191 --> 00:53:43.681
 Jeff Campbell>Does that work with for the map stuff?

00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:44.981
 Adam Hollohan>Yeah, that's great.

00:53:45.731 --> 00:53:46.051
 Jeff Campbell>Awesome.

00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:48.101
 Jeff Campbell>Umm.

00:53:49.071 --> 00:53:51.001
 Jeff Campbell>So yeah, we're going to town on this job.

00:53:51.011 --> 00:53:54.241
 Jeff Campbell>The text you know, completing everything, everything that they need to add in.

00:53:54.251 --> 00:54:03.331
 Jeff Campbell>If you want to give them permission to add materials and things like that, which does bring me to permissions, give your text whatever permissions you'd like them to have.

00:54:04.001 --> 00:54:04.591
 Jeff Campbell>Ohm.

00:54:04.881 --> 00:54:07.691
 Jeff Campbell>I'm not calendar on their their calendar that I showed you.

00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:10.171
 Jeff Campbell>They they were only that tech was only seeing their jobs.

00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:13.411
 Jeff Campbell>If you wanted them to see the week in advance, they can have permission to see that.

00:54:13.661 --> 00:54:24.551
 Jeff Campbell>If they you wanted them to be able to see all users and what they're doing for the day, you can give them permissions for that and then whatever you want to give them permission to see inside of here is totally up to you as well.

00:54:24.751 --> 00:54:26.451
 Jeff Campbell>We have two types of users.

00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:30.931
 Jeff Campbell>We have admin users and we have your basic users.

00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:40.871
 Jeff Campbell>Admin users have access to everything inside of service box and you're basic users have permissions for whatever you'd like them to have, and that could be on a tech to tech basis.

00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:49.461
 Jeff Campbell>You might have one tech you want them to be able to see and do certain things, and another tech you know you just want them to do this, this and this, and that's all they need to do in here and that's all they'll be able to do.

00:54:51.761 --> 00:54:54.721
 Jeff Campbell>And we'll work with you upon configuration with all that stuff as well.

00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:55.611
 Jeff Campbell>Uh.

00:54:55.901 --> 00:54:59.781
 Jeff Campbell>With permissions and getting things set up to your to your companies needs.

00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:03.441
 Jeff Campbell>Work notes that you add in.

00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:10.761
 Jeff Campbell>Maybe you're adding these units in, so you wanna add these cabinets onto this job site however you want to do that.

00:55:10.771 --> 00:55:14.121
 Jeff Campbell>You can add a snapshot to that you can put in descriptions.

00:55:14.591 --> 00:55:27.641
 Jeff Campbell>These are custom fields inside of here as well, so you can add fields inside for the type of cabinet and things like that so that you can always go back to this job site and find these units that you've installed.

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:30.661
 Jeff Campbell>I can go and pull up a unit that's already at this job site as well.

00:55:31.541 --> 00:55:35.431
 Jeff Campbell>This is just example purposes here obviously, but I can look at the details on this.

00:55:35.441 --> 00:55:53.041
 Jeff Campbell>The snapshot of it that's there and quick details on it, I kind of stopped but I can go into even further details as well and look at job site Info Pass checklist to DOS notes attachments that you have for that unit that you that you have at that job site.

00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:40.201
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

00:55:56.771 --> 00:55:57.871

00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:53.571
 Jeff Campbell>I think we were talk talking.

00:59:55.511 --> 00:59:56.651
 Jeff Campbell>You were looking at.

00:59:58.591 --> 01:00:01.681
 Jeff Campbell>Roughly the 10:50 people.

01:00:01.691 --> 01:00:06.151
 Jeff Campbell>And if you kept it at 10, it would save you 125 bucks a month.

01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:13.641
 Jeff Campbell>So basically with 10 users inside service box, the way that our pricing works is every 5 users cost you $125.00.

01:00:14.731 --> 01:00:18.501
 Jeff Campbell>So at 10 users, you'd be paying $250 Canadian per month.

01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:19.641
 Jeff Campbell>You're in Canada, right?

01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:22.521
 Adam Hollohan>Yep, Yep.

01:00:21.001 --> 01:00:21.501
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:22.231
 Jeff Campbell>Yeah.

01:00:22.241 --> 01:00:25.331
 Jeff Campbell>So $250 Canadian per month and we do have a setup fee as well.

01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:31.181
 Jeff Campbell>So that goes into our what we do to, umm, get it?

01:00:45.001 --> 01:00:51.881

01:00:51.961 --> 01:00:53.871
 Jeff Campbell>It's a $1500 setup fee.

01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:59.111
 Jeff Campbell>It's a one time fee that you pay, but that also goes towards all your ongoing support with us as well.

 Adam Hollohan>OK, cool.

01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:13.511
 Jeff Campbell>So quite a while, but really ramped up in the last five years really ramped up what we do.

01:01:13.521 --> 01:01:19.151
 Jeff Campbell>So we we, you know, I started the company grew at a smart pace.

01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:23.191
 Jeff Campbell>I must say I've been with the company for five years now, while getting close to five years here.

01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:22.081
 Adam Hollohan>OK.

01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:39.091
 Jeff Campbell>So company grew at a very nice pace and then once they were able to start ramping up, we ramped up obviously making sure that we can take care of our customers as we grew and and that's the most important thing to us is being able to take care of our customers.

01:01:39.101 --> 01:01:45.351
